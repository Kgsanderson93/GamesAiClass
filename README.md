Each folder is a seperate project which builds on the previous projects work. Folders should be dowloaded seperately and navigated to in your file system. For the most complete experience download HW4 and navigate into one of the inner top level folders each of which show off a different algorithm such as a decision tree or Learned Behavior Tree Decision Tree(LBTDT). The LBTDT model is particularly interesting as it takes data from the behavior tree model and trains an ai decision tree off it.
