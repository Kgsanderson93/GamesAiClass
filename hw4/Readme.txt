All parts can be run by navigating to the inner file and if necessary using make and ./main the file LBTDT is the learned behavior tree decision tree file. It has data included already for the tree learning and generation though it may take a moment or two to set up. If you want to try and run the model on different data the behavior tree generates a file on run called HW4data. this may be placed into the main folder for LBTDT and should replace the data provided.
